   - Use the `advanced_cluster_settings.md` guide

3. **Cluster Sizing Guidelines**:
   - Understand memory vs. CPU requirements
   - Optimize for different workloads
   - Consider cost implications
   - Review the recommendations in `cluster_sizing_guidelines.md`

## Step 3: Cluster Policies

1. **Creating Cluster Policies**:
   - Understand policy attributes and constraints
   - Create policies for different user groups
   - Set default values and allowed ranges
   - Use the `cluster_policy_template.json` as a reference

2. **Assigning Policies to Users and Groups**:
   - Configure policy permissions
   - Assign policies to specific groups
   - Implement policy hierarchy
   - Follow the steps in `policy_assignment.md`

3. **Policy Best Practices**:
   - Implement cost control policies
   - Create policies for different environments (dev, test, prod)
   - Balance flexibility and governance
   - See `policy_best_practices.md` for recommendations

## Step 4: Instance Pools

1. **Creating Instance Pools**:
   - Understand instance pool benefits
   - Configure pool settings:
     - Instance types
     - Minimum and maximum capacity
     - Idle instance timeout
   - Use the `instance_pool_template.json` as a reference

2. **Assigning Pools to Clusters**:
   - Configure clusters to use instance pools
   - Understand pool selection logic
   - Optimize for cost and performance
   - Follow the steps in `pool_assignment.md`

3. **Pool Management Strategies**:
   - Implement pools for different workloads
   - Configure preemptible instances
   - Optimize idle instance management
   - See `pool_management_strategies.md` for details

## Step 5: Autoscaling Configuration

1. **Understanding Autoscaling**:
   - Learn how Databricks autoscaling works
   - Understand autoscaling metrics and triggers
   - Review autoscaling limitations
   - See `autoscaling_overview.md` for details

2. **Configuring Autoscaling**:
   - Set minimum and maximum workers
   - Configure scale-up and scale-down behavior
   - Optimize for different workloads
   - Use the `autoscaling_configuration.md` guide

3. **Monitoring Autoscaling Behavior**:
   - Track scaling events
   - Analyze cluster utilization
   - Optimize autoscaling settings
   - Follow the steps in `autoscaling_monitoring.md`

## Step 6: Cluster Libraries and Init Scripts

1. **Managing Cluster Libraries**:
   - Install libraries on clusters
   - Understand library installation methods:
     - Workspace libraries
     - PyPI packages
     - Maven coordinates
     - DBFS or S3 uploaded JARs
   - Use the `library_management.md` guide

2. **Creating and Managing Init Scripts**:
   - Understand init script execution flow
   - Create global and cluster-specific init scripts
   - Implement security best practices
   - See `init_script_examples.md` for templates

3. **Library and Init Script Best Practices**:
   - Implement version pinning
   - Use init scripts for environment setup
   - Manage dependencies effectively
   - Follow recommendations in `library_best_practices.md`

## Step 7: Cluster Access Control

1. **Configuring Cluster Permissions**:
   - Set up cluster access control
   - Assign permissions to users and groups
   - Implement permission inheritance
